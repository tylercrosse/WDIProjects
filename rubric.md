## Project Feedback + Evaluation

#### Project Workflow:

  > Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Incomplete -**
I couldn't find your user stories or wireframe anywhere. Let me know if you have them someplace else and want to include them. Time spent on planning will ultimately save you time and headache as you build applications, particularly as what you build becomes increasingly complex.

#### Technical Requirements:

  > Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Performing -**
War is definitely one of the harder project to even meet the MVP for, great job pulling it all together! It would be awesome if you could incorporate those console logs and alerts like score into the page with DOM manipulation. Having a 'war' take place when the two hands are equal is awesome and was a bonus in the project prompt.

#### Code Quality:

  > Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did > you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Performing -**
The code looks good, nice naming of variables & functions, good consistent indentation, and use of whitespace. Instead of leaving large chunks of commented code in your file it's a good practice to commit and then delete it. Another best practice is to find ways to move as much of your program as possible out of the global namespace.

#### Creativity/Interface:

  > Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

**Performing -**
There are a lot of cool and creative things happening in this program. The background image and music are a really nice touch. It's also cool that you used images for the cards, that definitely makes it look nicer. If you decide to revisit this project I encourage you to incorporate all of the messages to the user into the DOM.

#### Total:

**Performing -**
All in all, nice work! :+1: This app definitely shows a solid foundational knowledge of the concepts we've covered in class and some creative solutions to the problems that arose as you constructed it. If you didn't do any planning for this project I definitely encourage you to spend some time before you start on the next project working to figure out exactly what features you might need. As we continue to learn new things in class don't be afraid to revisit this project and keep working on it, it could be a great portfolio piece.
